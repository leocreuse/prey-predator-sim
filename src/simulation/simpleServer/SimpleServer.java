/**
 * Simple Server for the Predators and Preys project.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The server first waits for a single TCP connection from a client, then will
 * read two integer values from the client, in binary format. The first integer
 * correspond to the size (in bytes) of extended prey data, the second to the
 * size of extended predator data. Extended creature data is additional
 * information transmitted after the mandatory (X,Y) position of the creature.
 * E.g: if your client sends an additional double value for each prey (e.g
 * direction), then the first integer sent at the beginning of the connection
 * must be 8 (eight bytes for the additional double value). If your client sends
 * an additional double value plus an int (e.g age) for each predator, then the
 * second integer sent at the beginning of the connection must be 12 (eight
 * bytes for a double plus four bytes for an int).
 * <P>
 * The server will then wait for messages from the client and respond to it in
 * an infinite loop, until the connection is broken by the client. A message is
 * typically sent by a client after each cycle of simulation.
 * <p>
 * The expected format of each message sent by the client is the following :
 * four integer values followed by two lists of creature data (one list for the
 * exiting preys, the second for the exiting predators). A prey or a predator is
 * leaving the square simulation if one or both of its coordinates are outside
 * the normalized square.
 * <p>
 * The four integer values are in this order: the number of remaining preys in
 * the client square simulation, the number of remaining predators (these two
 * values are just for statistical interest, they are currently printed by the
 * server on its console), the number of exiting preys, and the number of
 * exiting predators.
 * <p>
 * Each list of creature data may be empty (if the corresponding number of
 * exiting creatures is zero). Creature data is composed of two double values
 * followed by extended additional data: the two double values are the X and Y
 * coordinates (double values), the additional data might be anything defined by
 * the client, it will not be interpreted by the server, but retransmitted
 * without modification (hence the server parameters that define the size of
 * creatures' extended additional data).
